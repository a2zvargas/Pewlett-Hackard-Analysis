# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees, and identify which employees are eligible to participate in the mentorship program.

## Results: 

Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

1. A massive 30% of all employees are potentially retiring.
2. 64% of the potential retirees hold a senior level position.
3. 25% of all engineers are potentially retiring.
4. Only 2% of potential retirees are eligible for the mentorship program.

## Summary: 

Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
